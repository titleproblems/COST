*^I'm ^probably ^going ^to ^perfect ^the ^orange ^colors ^soon.*  
If you want a different color scheme, let me know and I'll make it when I have time!
  
###How to download (following these steps are important) :  
* Go to the github link for your prefered color, All the files are listed here: https://github.com/titleproblems/COST
* Scroll down and copy the "RAW Paste Data"
* Go to the subreddit settings, scroll down and click "edit the stylesheet". (located under "look and feel")  
* Paste CSS  
  
###Now you have the theme in place. There is still a few steps you have to follow:  
* Go to subreddit settings, and add this in the sidebar:  
    ######This is the top-bar. You can edit it to say whatever you want. Do not remove.  
* Now add this in the **bottom of the sidebar** (IMPORTANT: HAS TO BE ON THE BOTTOM):  



`> 1. Browse by flair â–¾  `


`> 2. [Flair1](link-here) ` 


`> 3. [Flair2](link-here)`  

Add as many of those as you want flairs.  
To get the links you are going to add, go to your subreddit, and search "flair:word", where "word" is the flair. Copy url and paste in instead of "link-here". Do this for all the flairs you want.  
###Now to adding the flairs:  
* Go to "edit flair"
* Change link flair position from "none" to "left" or "right". Save options. *^^I ^^prefer ^^left.*
* Click "link flair templates"  
* Add flairs like this: http://i.imgur.com/YLlEzkq.png (Make sure the css class says "flair"!)  
* Add as many as you want. And save them.
